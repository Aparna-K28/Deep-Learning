# Deep-Learning
In this assignment, for task 1 I have created dense architectures and CNN architectures to minimise the reconstruction error. 
In task 2, which is denoising task, I have created dense models and CNN models to accomplish the denoising task. Denoising is removing noise from an image.
Task 3 is text reconstruction wherein I have again created dense architectures, CNN models and complex CNN models using normalisation techniques to recover 
texts.
